# C# Algorithms!
This is a repository for a whole bunch of c# algorithms.

I used Visual Studio as the IDE of choice and this repository includes
the following Visual Studio files:

1. The .sln File
2. The App.config File
3. The .csproj file

The assembly name is "Algorithms"

Because of the wide variation of devices to which may be used to access this repository
the following folders have been exluded:

1. Algorithms/bin
2. Algorithms/obj

## Arguments for runnning
All arguments are not case sensitive as it is just a way of running the Algorithms file without needing people to
worry about specifically entering each argument.

1. Two-Sum
2. Add-Two-Nums
